# Getting Started with Micropython

Micropython doesn't have all the libraries pre installed on the system. To work
with these libraries we can use thonny or we can look at building from source

Installed Vagrant by downloading from their website and moving the vagrant file to /usr/bin
Had to install virtualbox for this to run as well
