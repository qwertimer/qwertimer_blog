One thing i want to get working is a fully automated system setup and configuration for the Jetson boards. Each time i break or get a new Jetson i dont like having to reinstall all packages. To this end i am designing to toolsets. The first is an ansible playbook for linux installation. (Basicallt installing all the required software.) The second one is a modular docker container which uses docker mods to add functionality.
