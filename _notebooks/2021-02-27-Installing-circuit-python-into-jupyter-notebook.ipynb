    "One issue that is faced in programming microcontrollers is the inability to quickly test code and see results. Python has the ability to run what is known as a REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop). REPLs provide an interactive way to program and debug code. Circuit python and micropython have introduced a new group of programmers to the embedded world. Now anyone can program a microcontroller using a simple high level language such as python (with some exceptions). However often times a new programmer wont understand how to interact with a microcontroller from the command line and will just flash code to the controller and hope to see results. We can overcome this by using screen in a terminal and point to the microcontroller. However this is messy and harder to follow when testing large code chunks. To overcome this Adafruit have released a circuitpython kernel for the Jupyter environment allowing users to program the microcontrollers in an interactive environment such as Jupyter. Below is the outline of how to do this."
