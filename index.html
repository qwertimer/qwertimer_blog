# Welcome to my Blog

This blog is a setup for me to host and store all my research and findings whilst working on python, linux and microcontrollers. If i find anything that is perfect from another site i will host a links to useful pages section. I plan to also add to this links to useful github repos and other sites of interest. For now however this site will evolve and grow as i move the information from my many locations. To the one unified place to store all information.
