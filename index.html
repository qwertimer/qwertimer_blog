# Welcome to my Blog

This blog is a setup for me to host and store all my research and findings whilst working on python, linux and microcontrollers. If i find anything that is perfect from another site i will host a links to useful pages section. I plan to also add to this links to useful github repos and other sites of interest. For now however this site will evolve and grow as i move the information from my many locations. To the one unified place to store all information.

        		<h1>Welcome to my site.</h1>
				<p>I have often found certain resources here and there over the internet that has helped me to get up and running in python, docker ,git
        everything in between. I often fail to remember these when i am working on a new project and thus have to go back and find the documents 
        and notes i have used to develop the work in the first place. To this end i decided to bring it all together on my personal github account 
        to save the plethora of notes and store all the varying processes i have looked at.
